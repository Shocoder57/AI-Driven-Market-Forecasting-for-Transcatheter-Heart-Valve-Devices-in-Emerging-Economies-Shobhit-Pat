High mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person survives his/her childhood of high mortality, he/she may live much longer. For example, in a population with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50.

Government finance statistics provide a detailed snapshot of a government's fiscal operations and health. They encompass data on revenue, expenditures, deficits, and debt levels, which are essential for crafting fiscal policy, budget planning, and economic forecasting. These statistics help policymakers manage public finances effectively, make informed decisions on taxation and spending, and set priorities for resource allocation. For investors, analysts, and the international community, government finance statistics serve as key indicators of a country's economic stability and creditworthiness. They also play a crucial role in ensuring transparency and accountability, as they allow citizens and oversight bodies to track how public funds are managed and spent, fostering democratic engagement and governance. More specifically, this indicator is related to the expense side of government finance statistics. The expense side of government finance statistics provides helpful detailed information on how a government spends its funds, including expenditures on public services, social programs, infrastructure, and debt servicing. This data is critical for assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of government spending and for ensuring that resources are being allocated to priority areas that support economic and social development. It also helps in evaluating the fiscal sustainability of government operations, as persistent high levels of spending relative to revenue can lead to budget deficits and increasing public debt. For citizens, understanding how their government is spending money is key to holding it accountable and ensuring that public funds are used in the public interest. For investors and credit rating agencies, the expense data is important for assessing a country's fiscal health and the risks associated with its sovereign debt.","For most countries central government finance data have been consolidated into one account, but for others only budgetary central government accounts are available.
